## Notes

I started off by creating the site and following instructions. I noticed that using PicoCSS is optional so I took a different path and used Tailwind. It started out good as the functionality of the site is connected to Supabase and it worked as intended but when I try to cusztomize it, that's when the difficulty began. I tried various ways to make it work but I ended up in circles going back to how it started. After that, I refactored the project and have it implement PicoCSS. Once I did that, I noticed a difference, the customization using PicoCSS was much more simpler than Tailwind. I understand now that Tailwind can't be used in every project/assignment and this is one of those cases. Afterwards, everything went smoothly to the end.
